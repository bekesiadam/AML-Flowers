# AML-Flowers

## Task
Classification of flower images and comparison of the models used. The classi-
fication will be performed using several different pre-trained models as well as
an independently configured custom model.
## Data
The dataset contains images of various resolutions, with approximately 15,000
images per resolution. Each image depicts a flower that belongs to one of 104
classes. Some classes are very narrow, containing only a particular sub-type of
flower while other classes contain many sub-types. The dataset contains imper-
fections: images of flowers in odd places, or as a backdrop to modern machinery.
The dataset is available on the following link:

## Milestones
First of all, we are planning to explore what we are dealing with. This process
will contain the understanding of the data, and prepare it for further usage.
To gain a deeper understanding of the problem we will search for other Kaggle
contributorâ€™s solutions, and then we will write our own notebook. Our idea
right now is that it will enables us to compare several pre-trained networks on
the data. Finally, we want to create our own network to see what we could do
against the robust deep pre-trained networks.

- Understanding the concepts (Week 4)
- See fellow solutions (Week 6)
- Compare pre-trained networks (Week 8)
- Create own baseline network (Week 10)
- Create own optimized network (Week 12)
